# Pets - A single-spa Demo App

A demo app for my talk on [single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org) at https://www.meetup.com/DublinJS/events/fbllfpyzkbdb/.

## Getting Started

1. This app loads 2 other apps so let's clone those apps.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tewson/single-spa-cat
   git clone https://github.com/tewson/single-spa-dog
   ```
2. In both `single-spa-cat` and `single-spa-dog`
   ```
   yarn
   yarn start
   ```
3. Then in `single-spa-pets` (this repo)
   ```
   yarn
   yarn start
   ```
4. Go to http://localhost:8082.
